# Blurb

I am currently pursuing a double major for Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of
Toronto Scarborough](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/). I am also a performer Somewhere over the
rainbow and TA for some cool theory course.

I write arrangements for existing somgs as well as original music predominantly for a small ensemble
though I enjoy performing and writing for moretraditional chamber music as well.

I formally studied Japanese language for four years and continue to practice by attending exchanges
where recently arrived Japanese-speakers go to improve their English. Spanish is my native tongue.

My interests lie primarily in programming optimized C, C++ and improving how software can be used to
express musical ideas.
