### Brief review of previous posts

Continue where left off last time, review very very briefly, and pick up.

### Structures are Malleable

Go over how malleable the structures introduced actually are and how making tweaks
can add spice and uniqueness, really make it your own. Go into more concrete examples of
how to bend it starting as simple as not following the "premade" or already introduced set
of chord movements, key changes, to time signatures, compound meter, and more involved and
theoretical concepts.

### Bending the correct way (like Beckham)

"Sounds good" is extremely relative, but can still pull these things
off without sounding absolutely dissonant, this is one of my favourite parts in fact. The
fine balance between innovative and practical mirrors the line between madness and genius.

, still follows theoretical rules,
and someone with no background at all can enjoy it without a story and a half to accompany
the piece. Kinda like maybe modern art? ahaha...... In short, rules still apply and is what
makes it interesting.

### Combining scale degrees and intervals

Both of these are a large factor when creating melodies, lines on top. A minor third is
always a minor third but if it lands in a certain scale degree in may not sound as dark.
**give an example here**

Talk also about melodies, there appears to be no preset structure for them but with experience
and most importantly imo, immersion in a large variety of musics, will begin to emerge an
intuition about where to go next. The most impressive part is then relationships with the
"core" chords and the feel those give the created melodies (mentioned last paragraph). Specifically when improvising,
the same line can even be used in different contexts to give it a different feel altogether.
**give an example here**

### Improvising and Perceived Complexity

Final note on melody, a lot of people tend to try to show off but not only does this depend
on the style upon which one is improvising on top of, take this bossa nova improv for example,
but it is usually not even the most pleasant one you can pull out. Again, being super
predictable is not necessarily a good thing and in fact can work to your detriment not to
mention that it will make it more easy to mess up and less space for you to focus on other
areas of the improv performance.


MAYBE:
hint at song analysis/composition and writing
