In this second entry, we will begin by formalizing the definition of what
it means to evoke these different types of "colours". These were briefly
mentioned in the first post in the context of major vs minor chords but
a more formal treatment will be useful in more precise analysis of relationships
between chords. Following that, we go over how the context can alter this
and how to use it to your advantage with regards to chords and scales.

### Definitions

In our current discussion about musical relationships we define

**Colour (emotion):** The phenomenon of mental association of a collection
of tones (often a chord)
with an experience or mood as a result of the intervals between them.
It is pertinent to the definition that we
have a collection of tones, though hearing an E in isolation may bring
memories of Ode to Joy and emotions follow, this is distinct to hearing
a minor third and the mood and experience of the song being different as
a result.

**Timbre:** The sonic qualities of tones which allows us to tell apart
different instruments, styles of playing etc.

### Scale Degrees

We begin this section with an informal introduction to one last topic of
traditional music theory. The colour which is painted by a set of notes
played together is relative to their distance or "interval" from each other.
From what we have already covered, an isolated C would not work to colour
or create the mood, however, playing the collection {C, E, G} produces a
different colour than {C, Eb, G}. As was pointed out earlier, what makes
these scales "major" or "minor" is the intervals, not the notes hence why E flat
major has a similar colour as C major despite the E flat seemingly
changing the mood of the chord.

This is an example of different moods which depend on notes played
simultaneously. An analogous effect occurs when the collections are played at
different points in time depending on who they appear next to. In other words,
the colour of a collection of tones C is in a sense a function of the notes
present (in C and in previous collections) and time.

**list here an example of a dark vs bright movement**

These are what are called scale degrees, and as mentioned in the first
paragraph are relative to some fundamental. Very much like in the case
when constructing chords, intervals are the main component which is at
play here. Playing a C chord from the fundamental followed by a chord a
perfect fifth away will have a different sound than the second chord being
a minor third away from the fundamental.

| Degree | Related Chord |
|:------:|:-------------:|
|    i   |     Major     |
|   ii   |     Minor     |
|   iii  |     Minor     |
|   iv   |     Major     |
|    v   |     Major     |
|   vi   |     Minor     |
|   vii  |   Diminished  |

These scale degrees also translate identically to scales having in fact
a similar result in terms of tone which they emit.

### Relation to Inversions

This then leads nicely to the discussion on inverted chords and their
role in chord movements.

Here is a motivating example, say we wish to have a bass line which moves
Downwards from C minor but want to keep those strong 3 and 5 (E flat, G)
which are present in your fundamental chord. Well, if you go down to the
previous note in the scale you land on B flat, on top you have E flat and
G. This is just the E flat major scale in a different order!

This has the benefit of allowing flexibility to the bass while the
tone from the corresponding scale still shines through. Notice the
difference for instance if instead we had used B flat, D G (G minor).
Not nearly as "happy", yet the bass still ended up in our desired position.
Use this to your advantage when playing with movement of the low end.

This is in fact widely used in all sorts of music, here is one progression
I enjoy which makes good use of chord inversions:

### Cadence and Resolutions

We have now seen how the environment in which a chord finds itself can alter the emotion it evokes,
turns out this is but one aspect which chords and their surroundings affects our perception. There
are a number of other effects we can have on the listener, one which has stood the test of time and
culture is a sense of completeness or *resolution*.

There are certain chords which lend themselves to having a sound which make the listener seek
resolution. This is actually an important concept to grasp as it can cause suspense or tension and
if implemented correctly, adds a real weight to what is being played. I can probably dedicate an
entire post to thi phenomenon but it suffices to say that it is important and I will go over two
movements which can cause this feeling here.

The first is what is called a cadence, these are simply the first inversion of the chord which is
a perfect fifth away from the fundamental and played minor if the fundamental is major and vice
versa. There are a number of factors going on here but one I would like to point out in particular
is the presence of the second, fifth, and seventh (flat or natural) note in the scale. These are the
second category I would like to talk about and this cadence is in fact just a strong member in this
class or chords. The chords which lie at these positions relative to the scale tend to want to
resolve and can be key in emotional impact of a performance.

### Progressions

We now arrive at one of the essential constructs for improvisation as a whole, chord progressions.
At the most fundamental level, chord progressions are simply a sequence of chords played
consecutively though with what we have learned so far, we can do more just arbitrarily throw chords
together so let's do just that. Start out by choosing a key, remember that for our purposes the
choice of key doesn't make a difference so let's go with A major.

For simplicity, we start on our fundamental and hit an A chord. We wish to remain in an "upbeat"
sound but want a transition before seeking a resolution, the chord which fits the bill is the
one a perfect fourth away, so we take D major next. Now we can naturally have a little bit of
tension and have the listener want some resolution and still keep our all-major pattern. Here,
G major would do just fine. Finally, we give the listener what they are looking for and go back
to C.

This chord progression is one which is extremely prevalent throughout modern pop music and we
can now explain why. Of course, like any creative field, there is nothing saying you absolutely
must follow these rules to a T. There are a lot of common progressions across different genres
and styles, and you can always make them up as you go, hence improvisation.

Using what we have learned so far, let us try to construct
Begin by motivating the 1-4-5-1 progression, continue by encouraging you
create your own progressions, and present a few common progressions that
are also used.
