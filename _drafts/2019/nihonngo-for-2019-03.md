This is a post for practicing japanese. From now on, I plan on writing one of these one week of each
month and write on a variety of topics. As the debut topic, I will write about the University of
Toronto. The University of Toronto was founded in 1837(?). Because of that, much of the architecture
is really old.

talk about: clubs, students/student life (international students), courses, professors, etc.

I currently attend a weekly math seminar which covers interesting topics and in fact was the
inpiration for the post earlier this week on homology. This is a good environment for dicussion on
various topics and levels in mathematics. Being able to impart knowledge of a topic is in fact
a skill which I am working on in my job as a piano instructor and wish to hone further as a teaching
assistant.

I am also a regular at a readings group which is focused on undergraduate research. There, we
discuss papers having to do with computer science education. **Talk more about this**
