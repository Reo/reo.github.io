I find it interesting and enlightening to ask people I meet about their experiences with playing a
musical instrument. Unfortunately, too often I hear that they used to play an instrument --- usually
piano --- and no longer practice it. From my own experiences playing as a hobby, professionally, and
teaching piano, I found that learning to improvise greatly improves retention and interest resulting
in a better experience with music as a whole. Unfortunately, most formal music studies spend little
to no time on improvisation, this series of posts hopes to help those with a strong interest in music
get started with improvisation.

### Overview

Improvisation on the piano is something special and a discipline which deserves practice on its own.
It's the intersection of music theory, creative composition, and technical ability. This first
entry will go over some basic review of music theory and lead into the next where we will discuss
how it relates to composition.

My goal for the reader is that they have a strong foundation on which to begin experimenting and
developing their own style. Like learning any new skill, just getting started may not yield the
most impressive results but with time and practice comes experience

As mentioned above, the first post will go into a review of the music theory which will
be relevant to discussions to take place in upcoming posts. Following the review, this introductory
post also makes a case for why one would even bother with music theory when, in practice,
improvisation is often seen as a very technically demanding or performance-oriented skill.

Following this post, I will go into more detail covering relationships between chords and between scales.
There is quite a bit to go over here since I consider variations on chords and scales to fall
under this section. This discussion will also feature a very brief mention of how the scales
and their relationships may then translate to very basic melodies though the bulk of this is
reserved to the third post.

In the third post, I take what we've covered in the two previous posts and relate them to a more
abstract section of writing which is that of melodic lines. This is an aspect commonly found to
be the most frustrating yet rewarding part of the improvisation process. When one sets out on
their journey towards becoming a a great improviser, it can often be demotivating to not be able
to create melodies all too quickly like one may imagine the professionals do. I go over this
more mental and psychological aspect in the third part as well.

### Brief review of relevant material

We begin with a review which goes over *scales*, *modes*, and *chords*.

Scales are one of the foundational pieces in music for good reason, there is much we can expand on
by taking notes from a given sequence. For instance, the often-used major and minor scales are
relatively open to change and this allows one to express oneself more creatively. We define the
major scale as a _heptatonic_ (7 note) scale which visits the root (note the scale is named after)
followed by the notes a distance of tone, tone, semi-tone, tone, tone, tone, semi-tone from the
preceding one. The observant reader will notice that we end up back where we started, this is
useful since we now know that a cycle has been reached and all the notes present in the scale are
simply the ones before this cycle.

There is in fact an interesting discussion to be had with the Number Theory which lies behind the
interval at which we choose the members of a scale but that discussion is saved for a future post.

This sort of choosing of intervals can be done similarly to create scales which have more, or less
notes; to create scales which have a more unorthodox timbre, etc. I present here a few more
scales which we will find useful in the future, a discussion on their properties and relationships
will happen in the next entry in this series. For brevity, we use position relative to the root (ie.
1 is the root note, ‚ô≠5 is three tones away, etc.)

| name          | Intervals        |
|:-------------:|:----------------:|
| Major         | 1-2-3-4-5-6-7    |
| Minor         | 1-2-‚ô≠3-4-5-‚ô≠6-‚ô≠7 |
| Pentatonic    | 1-2-3-5-6        |
| Blues         | 1-‚ô≠3-4-‚ô≠5-5-‚ô≠7   |

We now turn our attention to chords. Intuitively, we may think of chords as grounding what may
otherwise be notes in isolation or "floating". It gives context to what is being said by the
melody, yet they are strong enough to be used in isolation given the correct environment. As you
can probably imagine, these chords are pretty important, so precisely what are they?

without delving too deep into acoustics and physics behind sound. There are certain notes which
appear often in the overtone series of a produced sound.

![TITLE-Overtone-series-of-C](http://www.portlandpianolab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Harmonic-Series-2400dpi-new.png){:class="img-responsive"}

As you can see, the fundamental (C) as well as third (E) fifth (G) notes of C major appear amongst
the strongest and as you can imagine, they fit well when played together ([click here to read
more on this](https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/chords.html)). We call this 3-tuple a C major chord.

Now, this serves as good intuition for why initially choose the notes we do for the chords but the
scale is where we will actually be drawing notes from, for instance, a C minor scale would then
be the 3-tuple (C, E‚ô≠, G).

Chords are not restricted to three notes or the tones present in the scale they are based upon
however, and just as shifting the E in a C major chord down a semi-tone to E‚ô≠ changes the
timbre, altering other notes in the chord is allowed with exception given to the tone the chord is
rooted at. An exception for this is the so called augmented chord which brings the fifth in a major
scale up a semi-tone. Specifically, a C major augmented would then be (C, E, G‚ôØ).

When used in combination with the aforementioned leeway for addition (or removal) of notes,
this allows for a lot of freedom in experimenting the changes in moods which adjusting these
parameters brings. Do note this is not absolute since chords are also a function of time so this
timbre may change depending on the environment, the next post goes more into detail with regards to
this. I list a few which will be referred to in the future here:

|     name    |      notes      | notation |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:--------:|
|    major    |    {1, 3, 5}    |     C    |
|  augmented  |    {1, 3, ‚ôØ5}   |    C+    |
|    major7   |   {1, 3, 5, 7}  |    C‚ñ≥    |
|  dominant7  |  {1, 3, 5, ‚ô≠7}  |    C7    |
|    minor    |    {1, ‚ô≠3, 5}   |    Cm    |
| diminished7 | {1, ‚ô≠3, ‚ô≠5, ùÑ´7} |    C¬∞    |
|    minor7   |  {1, ‚ô≠3, 5, ‚ô≠7} |    Cm7   |

### Applications of Theory in Improvisation

We may now start to introduce more abstract topics in our study of improvisation on the piano.

To create a healthy foundation, it will be fitting to start this discussion with chords which we
learned provides context. The mood which is provided by chords changes depending on the culture and
has in fact changed throughout time but taking a modern-day and western approach there are agreed
upon perceptions. Again, it is important to emphasize that the environment
can make an enormous difference and change this list though this is still useful when considering
the chords in isolation.

Major chords are said to sound "happy" or even "heroic",
minor chords are more "dark" or "serious"
Major/minor 7ths are more full-sounding when compared to their three note counterpart

with this in mind, we can already start to create some simple improvisations by choosing a chord
upon which to base it on, play it on the left hand. And simply choose notes from the corresponding
scale and play them using your right hand. It will sound static and maybe the rhythms and melody
will be a little dull but alternating just one or two chords is a good exercise when starting out.

I recommend in fact getting comfortable with playing without having music in front or planned out.
Experiment and create on the spot with only these fundamentals in mind and if you're feeling
adventurous mix in some changes to the chord being played in the left hand. Add a note or two not
in the corresponding scale. Allowing yourself to make mistakes means you begin to gain intuition
towards what does and does not work.
