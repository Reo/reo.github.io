**TODO: MAKE LESS DRY, ADD PICTURES**

Overview/points:

Starting out: evaluating student goals and interest

Student goals: common examples include
"I want to learn these songs I heard in a movie/video game etc."
"I want to be able to do X technique on the piano"
"I want to improve my current playing ability"
"I want to be able to effectively learn any song on the piano"
"I want to be able to show off to my friends"
"I want to be able to make my own music"

note that the completion criterea of some are much more clear than others and that goals are
notdisjoint, and in fact usually students have a number of them with varying priorities. These goals
will also influence the actual teaching style to be used.

In particular, time spent on theory will be quite different for someone who wishes to compose their
own pieces when compared to a student who is interested predominantly on maximizing the number of
songs they learn.

Interests also play a role. For example,
What type of music are they interested in?
Do they have hobbies/interests outside of piano which they feel uch stronger about?
etc.
These become a factor when assigning practice, homework and such. A student who is learning piano on
top of 12 other types of practice they have, say various sports and other artistic abilities, will
not have the same time and often same drive to dedicate to piano and one can't expect that the
student owes them that time. In the contrary, knowing that beforehand can help set a practice
schedule which is consistent and more effective yielding better results. This also benefits the
instructor since they can know what sort of change they can expect from the student and notice
periods where perhaps the student may be struggling or show significant improvement and react
accordingly.

That being said, it is important to retain interest if the student is to put in the time and make
meaningful progress towards the goals.

As with most endevours, the road to completion is a hilled one containing moments of varying
progress, this is where maintaining interest for the student is especially crucial.
It is just as important to prevent backwards movement during uphill stretches
as it is to gain as much momentum as possible while going downhill.

How to maintain student interest?

This is an interesting area of research on its own but there are a few key points which are often
brought up. Te first of which ties in nicely to the previous section and that is setting checkpoints
for goals.

As the student moves forward, there are countless factors in and outside of music which affect how
productive they are in the practice. There is no way to account for all of these and it may seem
like progress towards a goal has been halted entirely which creates a self fulfilling prophecy of
less enthusiasm and effective practice because of the bleak outlook of the goal and little to no
process being made as a result.

Setting checkpoints towards the goal helps with these moments in a number of ways. For one, it
clearly defines stages which the student can look back on and see that not only has progress been
made, but it has been meaningful enough to warrant passing stages. More importatntly in my opinion
however, is that they can see the last checkpoint they passed and make a point to keep that up. It
is a lot easier to maintain a point even when external factors are making it difficult. This allows
the student to feel like they continue where they left off and results in much higher spirits when
problems get sorted out.

how? Create checkpoints to goals, mould teaching to student interests

This sums up a broad overview of my experience teaching piano thus far and as I'm sure it will
evolve. Look forward to these sorts of posts in the future with either more observations or which
go beyond the surface of an idea touched upon in this post.








Though I have been a member of a number of ensembles, most of my time playing piano has been
performing and writing for myself. It wasn't until I had a more serious commitment with expressing
and teaching these ideas to a younger student that I realized a number of concepts which I have
taken for granted throughout my career are in fact not necessarily immediately obvious. This
post covers more the teaching and self-growth aspect of this as opposed to actual music
fundamentals which have already been covered [in this blog post](www.google.com).

I'll start in more abstract and work my way down to specific instances regarding the instrument
I have been teaching (piano). First and foremost is attitude towards an instrument vs that in
disciplines which are more physical. A beginner instrumentalist will usually begin their practice
like any other task viewed as being "not physically intensive" like reading or watching a movie.
In the last two examples, there is some activity and movement, but it is uncommon for anyone to
limber up before starting a book, or even put too much consideration into the wrists and shoulders
when typing up an essay, however, practice of an instrument is indeed usually quite different from
the two aforementioned activities.

Stretching is in fact highly recommended as it can prevent injuries which can grown to be chronic if
not properly taken care of.

There is also a detail concerning the act of actually teaching theoretical concepts to those who
are seeing it for the first time.

There appears to be a sort of hierarchy when it comes to what should be taught and when. An example
which is a little silly may be teaching the circle of fifths before the student knows what an
interval is, or even what is meant by a flat or a sharp. I actually began putting more thought into
this since I found that some students would have good questions about concepts they "know" but maybe
do not yet have a complete grasp of what it means.

A concrete example is in one of my first pupils, they showed some understanding of musical concepts
such as sharps and flats and gave a few examples. I then took for granted that they had completely
grasped the idea and went on to teach those which follow in the so-called hierarchy to then realize
that the level of understanding was not quite where I had expected. Common questions include "What
is C flat? Is a sharp the next black key up?". These are good questions in that they show the level
of understanding and inquiry the student has for a topic (in this case, sharps or flats).

I highly encourage this sort of participation before moving on and though there is no way to
evaluate that a student is in fact comfortable with all aspects, it is possible to do so with a
good amount of confidence so that it minimizes the amount of difficulty it causes in learning
a topic which builds upon it.
