The posted version of this will be in Japanese, English, and Spanish

Here I go over details on a small reduction I worked on. The reduction is
from a piece originally composed for guitar by Antonio Lauro  and arranged for "orquestra de sala"
("hall orchestra") by Aldemaro Romero. As the title suggests, these are Venezuelan composers and the
song has become a sort of folk songs following a lot of what gives Venezuelan music its identity.

The obvious starting point is to listen to both the original piece and the one which is being
reduced presented here:

**TODO PRESENT THE SONGS HERE**

It is also useful to listen to songs in the same style to establish common elements which are should
be present and possibly even emphasised. This part is more vague as it's not as easy to define
"Venezuelan folk songs similar to this one" but lucky for us, there are a few things to look out for
say the time signature which is actually quite common for Venezuelan folk. We may simply take other
songs composed by Antonio Lauro and well known classics such as Alma Llanera in this case.

* * *

Now that we have a basis it will be useful to deconstruct the orchestration into pieces where we may
easily assign to one of the target instruments. Seeing as the timbre of an instrument is one of its
defining aspects, assign parts by similarity in this measure would be convenient so we deconstruct
the piece by timbre. It is important to note that though an instrument often retains its defining
timbre throughout the piece, different ways for an instrument to be expressed allow a single
instrument to have a variety of textures. In this instance, we will see that we categorize pizzicato
and legato strings separately despite the same instrument being used for both.

The first instrument which presents itself is the flute at a high register which the guitar
struggles to reah if at all manages to do so. It is also anything but percusive which is a quality
of the guitar I plan on taking great advantage of for this arrangement. the piano then starts off
the piece. For the sake of keeping the post length reasonable, I will not make a detailed analysis
of every decision but I will make an effort to justify every decision I deem to be a major factor in
the final result.









talk about more traditional Venezuelan songs such as Pasillaneando
and Antonio Lauro's works. And present the piano reduction to the
orchestral arrangement by Aldemaro Romero

Talk about the analysis, and how went about making the reduction for two instruments
defend why choices were made at what time etc.

The reduction was a project which began as a small work for a tribute in a sense
to Venezuela and its current state. Most importantly, the state of the population.
All that really aside, I found that the arrangement by Aldemaro Romero
has instruments which can be categorized (generally) as strings which are strummed
or plucked, and all other instruments (which are generally played more legato).
This observation lead me to a simple way of selecting who plays which part of the
arrangement to some extent, with creative freedom giving leeway to some extent.

I began the writing process by having the complete solo scores for both the piano
and guitar parts layed out. I then focused on one section at a time, listening to
the orchestration a few times identifying what plays which role how and it would
work best in the context of a duet. This is coupled with previous arrangement
experience and intuition gained from listening to other pieces which allows me to
put my own spin on it as opposed to simply transcribing what I hear.

## Section 1

The first section begins with a solo instrument which is then accompanied by a bass,
more pitched instruments in harmony, and a bass part which has the same purpose as
it does in Lauro's original composition, namely, keeping the it "grounded". Like the
other sections, this first part is played twice and though it is played the
same both times in the orchestral arrangement, I felt the need to highlight the guitar
more seeing as this is a duet so I decided to have the guitar play the melody for
the latter half the first time around while still keeping its place in the
arrangement as the strumming instrument the second time.

## Section 2

Thi section is one which really brings out the ability for the guitar's strings
to be percussive and Aldemaro Romero seems to have agreed in keeping this texture
to the passage choosing to have plucked strings play the descending bass to top
chord pattern while the flute plays the mixed part in between. The latter half is
more legato in the composition and Aldemaro Romero seems to really have wanted to
show this change by choosing to have extremely legato strings playing said part
while the bass is a note held throughout the bowed bar. A final note is that
during the latter half, the rhythm is still solidly held by a combination of the
percussion and strummed guitar.

In the duet arrangement, the first part is still taken predominantly by the guitar
which does a much better job of percussive sounding attack, while the piano takes
care of teh additional little bits added by Romero such as glockenspiel and bass
details. In the second half, the piano takes over the extreme legato melody and to
some extent the held bass but this is shared by a tremolo on the guitar which
serves the purpose of emphasizing the held bass as well as rhythm which is the
guitar's primary role for now. the tremolo to strummed hits allows the guitar to
do both at once.

We notice again that the goal I had set up of not overly emphasizing one
instrument shows here in the interchange of who is responsible for the more
visible melody vs supporting role. In this case, such different textures along
with no large burden on a single instrument allow
the part to be repeated nearly identical the second time around.

## Section 3

Finally, we have section 3 which has a focus on...... something TBA
