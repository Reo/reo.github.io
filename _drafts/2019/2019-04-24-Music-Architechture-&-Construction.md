This will be the beginning to a new type of series of posts I will make which will focus
on analysis of a variety of songs. It will start with more straight-forward music in terms
of technical writing and playing but we will delve deeper as the series moves forward. As
with most things to do with music, some of the decisions made are subjective but always
done with justification.

First, we set some ground rules on what the analysis will cover specifically:

We begin by dividing the song into "sections" which are often repeated in music. For example,
a pop song which follows a "Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus" pattern may be written
down as "ABABCB" or if the final chorus is somehow noticably different we may write: 
"ABABCB'".
