After reading about the various capabilities of web APIs, I decided I should take advantage and write
something which would be useful both for increasing my productivity and learning about web
technologies which I personally have not worked much with. This spurred the beginning of a project
which I have titled WunderFetch.

There will be a number of posts regarding this project, this is a format I may use for future
projects. I begin with a "project motivation" post which shows a high level overview of the
specifications/features I intend for the program to have. Next, is a discussion of the technologies
involved, followed by information about specific implementations to take advantage of said
technologies in a specific language (these usually take the form of libraries, built in functions, etc. for a particular language).
The exciting part comes next, I walk through construction of an implementation in a scripting
language as a prototype to get a high level overview of what we plan on doing.

Finally, the final post formally in the series will have a walk through coding a completed version
of the program which, if we did everything right, will fufill the conditions set out at the initial
stage. There may also be additional commentary afterwards if I deem it necessary.

As for this project's motivation: besides satisfying curiousity, WunderFetch is motivated by wanting
to automate the fetching of assignments, notes, etc. for my courses. when prompted, it will download
content from the course website and create a new task in Wunderist to attend to the newly downloaded
content.
