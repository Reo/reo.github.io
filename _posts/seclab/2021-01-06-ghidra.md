In this exercise, we find the password in a simple crackme
using Ghidra.
The purpose is to serve as an introduction
to ghidra for reverse engineering projects.

## The Target Binary

***

For this example we will use a custom binary to crack. If you want to follow
along, a simple crackme can be found at [this website](https://crackmes.one/crackme/5b8a37a433c5d45fc286ad83).
The password required for extraction is `crackmes.one`.

running the target binary, perhaps in a virtual machine we get

```
$ ./reverse
Enter an 8 character password as an argument
```

so it expects an 8-character string, giving it a valid argument we see

```
$ ./reverse 12345678
Access Denied!
```

we will use Ghidra to figure out the string our binary expects.

## Booting up Ghidra

***

Installing Ghidra is as simple as extracting the zip file found
on [the homepage](https://ghidra-sre.org/).

On Windows systems, you can double click on `ghidraRun.bat`.
On Linux and MacOS, you can start Ghidra by opening a terminal window
in the extracted directory and running

```
$ ./ghidraRun
```

(if you get an error related to the Java runtime please see the [Installation Guide](https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html))

You'll be greeted with the user agreement.
We hit "I agree" and continue to the Project Manager window seen below. We can close
all the other windows we are not concerned about right now.

<br>

***

## Opening a New Project

***

The remaining window should look something like

![Opening a new project](/assets/images/ghidra3.png)
{: style="text-indent: 0;"}

We create a new project navigating to *File > New Project*, create a *Non Shared Project*,
and select a project directory and project name. To import the binary, you can either use
*File > Import File* or drag and drop the binary to the window. For our purposes, Ghidra
correctlyl detected the format and language so we simply click ok. You will see a summary
which complains about unresolved symbols but we can ignore this warning and continue by
clicking *OK*. The screen should now look as follows:

![Opening the Code Browser](/assets/images/ghidra6.png)
{: style="text-indent: 0;"}

We can now continue to the code browser by double clicking on the name of the binary. You
will likely get a prompt asking if you would like Ghidra to analyze the file, click "Yes".
Most of the default options are fine as they are, though I recommend turning on the
*Decompiler Parameter ID* since it often improves decompilation results and hit Analyze.

![Decompiler Parameter ID](/assets/images/ghidra7.png)
{: style="text-indent: 0;"}

## Finding main()

***

Now, we can begin by finding the entry point. On the left-hand side, under the label
*Symbol Tree* we open the folder which says *Functions* and click the item which says
*entry*

![entry point](/assets/images/ghidra8.png)
{: style="text-indent: 0;"}

In the **decompile** window, we see
`__libc_start_main()`.
Finding [documentation](https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/baselib---libc-start-main-.html).
for its signature, we see the first argument is a pointer to `main()`.

```
int __libc_start_main(int *(main) (int, char * *, char * *), int argc, char * * ubp_av, void (*init) (void), void (*fini) (void), void (*rtld_fini) (void), void (* stack_end))
```

so we double click that first function

![main](/assets/images/ghidra10.png)
{: style="text-indent: 0;"}

<br>

***

## Cleaning up the Decompilation

***

Now, the signature to `main()` is well known so we can clean up the decompilation a little.
Right click on the function name at the top, select Edit Function Signature, and paste the signature:

![cleaning up](/assets/images/ghidra11.png)
{: style="text-indent: 0;"}

From here, we can see that `iVar2` is being used to store the length of the string and
`iVar1` to decide whether or not access is granted. We can rename those appropriately
by right clicking and clicking *Rename Variable*.

We can continue in this fashion peering through the function used to set `iVar1`'s value
and so on until we figure out how to get our binary to output `Acess Granted`.

As you keep experimenting, you may want to retype variables (done similarly to renaming)
or peek into the assembly on the listing window.

## An (Occasionally) Useful Shortcut

***

In this crackme, it all comes down to a string comparison.
Running [ltrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ltrace)
we can see the calls to shared libraries

```
$ ltrace ./reverse abcdefgh
strlen("abcdefgh")                                                                                                                = 8
strcmp("abcdefgh", "dqw4w9wgxcq")                                                                                                 = -3
strcmp("^]\\[ZYXWWXYZ[\\]^", "Z(-.*/W++W/*.-(Z")                                                                                  = 4
puts("Access Denied!"Access Denied!
)                                                                                                            = 15
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

First, notice that we again see the call to `strlen()` we caught in our decompilation with Ghidra.
We also notice that the only comparison done with equal-length strings is the second instance of
`strcmp()`
though the string we sent has clearly been manipulated. To study the manipulation,
we send a convenient string

```
$ ltrace ./reverse aaaaaaaa
strlen("aaaaaaaa")                                              = 8
strcmp("aaaaaaaa", "dqw4w9wgxcq")                               = -3
strcmp("WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW", "Z(-.*/W++W/*.-(Z")                  = -3
puts("Access Denied!"Access Denied!
)                                          = 15
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

from this, we can guess that the modification is simply a shift by 10 in the ascii value
along with reversing and duplicating the string. It then suffices to find the ascii which correspond to
adding 10 to the numerical values of `+W/*.-(Z`. (This is especially suspicious since the length of this
string is exactly 8).

We get `5a94872d`, trying this out

```
$ ./reverse 5a94872d
Access Granted!
```

as expected.
