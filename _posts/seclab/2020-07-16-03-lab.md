An example usage of stream cipher [Salsa20](https://cr.yp.to/snuffle.html)
to encrypt and decrypt audio data.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import Salsa20
import wave

def encrypt(keyFile, inputFile, outputFile):
    '''
    Encrypts the wave inputFile with the keyFile using the Salsa20 cipher (from PyCryptodome)
    and writes the wave outputFile
    The wave outputFile is a playable wave file.
    '''
    key = open(keyFile, 'rb').read()

    wr = wave.open(inputFile, 'rb')
    prms = wr.getparams()
    pframes = wr.readframes(wr.getnframes())

    cipher = Salsa20.new(key=key)
    msg = cipher.nonce + cipher.encrypt(pframes)

    ww = wave.open(outputFile, 'wb')
    ww.setparams(prms)
    ww.writeframes(msg)

    wr.close()
    ww.close()
    return

def decrypt(keyFile, inputFile, outputFile):
    '''
    Decrypts the wave inputFile with the keyFile using the Salsa20 cipher (from PyCryptodome)
    and writes the wave wave outputFile
    The wave output file is a playable wave file.
    '''
    key = open(keyFile, 'rb').read()

    wr = wave.open(inputFile, 'rb')
    prms = wr.getparams()
    msg = wr.readframes(wr.getnframes())

    msg_nonce = msg[:8]
    cframes = msg[8:]

    cipher = Salsa20.new(key=key, nonce=msg_nonce)
    pframes = cipher.decrypt(cframes)

    ww = wave.open(outputFile, 'wb')
    ww.setparams(prms)
    ww.writeframes(pframes)

    wr.close()
    ww.close()
    return
```
