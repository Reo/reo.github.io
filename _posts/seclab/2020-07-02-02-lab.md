This series goes over labs completed in a security course.
We first go over cryptography and will be implementing an elementary cipher to begin.

The [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is a substitution cipher
supposedly used for obfuscating messages by Julius Caesar. It is straightforward
where the key is simply an amount to shift every plaintext character

Notice that in the modern english alphabet, this leaves only 26 possible distinct keys
(including insecure keys).

One may then encrypt by "shifting right" by the amount specified by the key
and similarly decrypt by "shifting left" by the same amount.

An example implementation may then look like

```python
arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g',
       'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o',
       'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w',
       'x', 'y', 'z']

def encrypt(key, plaintext):
''' encrypts the plaintext with a key
    based on the caesar cipher algorithm
    and returns the ciphertext
'''
    shift = int(key)
    ciphertext = ""
    for c in plaintext:
        x = arr.index(c)
        x = (x + shift) % 26
        ciphertext += arr[x]
    return ciphertext

def decrypt(key, ciphertext):
''' decrypts the ciphertext with a key
    based on the caesar cipher algorithm
    and returns the plaintext
'''
    shift = int(key)
    plaintext = ""
    for c in ciphertext:
        x = arr.index(c)
        x = (x - shift) % 26
        plaintext += arr[x]
    return plaintext
```

notice that a fatal flaw of this method is the fact that there are only 26 distinct keys
making a brute force attack trivial while also falling to other pitfalls of simple
substitution ciphers such as frequency analysis.
