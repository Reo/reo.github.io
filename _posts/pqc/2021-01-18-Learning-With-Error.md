Continuing our discussion of post-quantum crytpography,
we study Learning with Error (LWE) problems. LWE is a simpler
example which is handy to use when introducing Learning with Rounding in
SABER which is one of the candidates which has made it into round 3 submissions for
[NIST post-quantum crypto](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography)
competition.

## Systems of Linear Equations

***

Before introducing LWE, we consider a related and more well known problem:

Given matrices $$\color{Green}A$$ and $$\pmb{\color{Green}b}$$,
can we find the value of $$\pmb{\color{Goldenrod}x}$$ which satisfies the equation:

$$
\color{Green}A\pmb{\color{Goldenrod}x} = \pmb{\color{Green}b}
$$

if this is a difficult problem, we may be able to use it as a public-key system where
$$(A,\pmb{b})$$ is a public key and $$\pmb{x}$$ a secret key. Unfortunately, from
our Linear Algebra courses we know this can be solved efficiently, say with Gaussian Elimination
and hence is not fit for a crypto system.

Modifying our system slightly, suppose we populate our matrices with elements from the field
$$\mathbb{Z}_q$$ and introduce a small error $$\pmb{e}$$:

$$
\color{Green}A\pmb{\color{Goldenrod}x} + \pmb{\color{Brown}e} = \pmb{\color{Green}b}
$$

Finding the corresponding value for $$\pmb{x}$$ is essentially the LWE problem and it turns out this is not only difficult,
[Regev showed](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1060590.1060603)
a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as SVP (mentioned in the previous post)
to LWE. In particular, LWE would be secure against quantum adversaries assuming quantum hardness
of lattice problems such as SVP which have been studied [more rigourously](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.vanemdeboas/vectors/mi8104c.html).

## Relation to Lattice Problems

***

If we take the columns of $$A$$ to be basis vectors in $$\mathbb{Z}^n_q$$ and letting $$\pmb{s}\in\mathbb{Z}^n_q$$ vary, we see
$$A\pmb{s}$$ is the set of points on a lattice. For example, if we have $$q=5$$, $$A=
\begin{bmatrix}
1, 3\\
2, 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$, and $$\pmb{s} =
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

we get the point $$[3,1]$$ on the lattice. If we perturb this point with our error $$\pmb{e}$$ we get $$\pmb{b}$$ shown in pink
in the graphic below. Notice since we are working in a finite field, we need only consider the points within
$$[0,5]\times[0,5]$$ (since all others are equivalent mod $$q=5$$)

Knowing $$\pmb{b}$$ is within the pink circle (knowing the nearest lattice point) is the fundamental statement of
the "Bounded Distance Decoding" problem which LWE is based on.

## Public Key System

***

With the conjectured quantum-hardness of LWE it would be convenient to be able to create a public-key encryption
system. We need to choose a modulus $$q$$ and ensure all parties are working over the same field $$\mathbb{Z}_q$$.
For example, suppose we have $$q=17$$.

For simplicity, we will encrypting only a single bit but this process [can be generalized](https://frodokem.org/)
for sending larger chunks of data.

Suppose we have a bit $$m$$ we would like to encrypt. We can encode this for our system by computing

$$
m' = \left\lfloor \frac{q}{2} \right\rfloor m = 8\times m
$$

### Key Generation

***

Key generation can done as follows:
1. Generate the matrix $$A\in\mathbb{Z}^{n\times n}$$ with entries sampled uniformly from $$[0,q-1]$$
2. Generate the secret $$\pmb{s}\in\mathbb{Z}^{n\times 1}$$ with entries sampled uniformly from $$[0,q-1]$$
3. Generate the error term $$\pmb{e}\in\mathbb{Z}^{n\times 1}$$ with entries sampled from a discrete Gaussian Distribution (*)
4. Compute $$\pmb{b}=A\pmb{s} + \pmb{e}$$

The public key is $$(A, \pmb{b})$$ and secret key is $$\pmb{s}$$.

### Encryption

***

Suppose Bob wants to encrypt the message $$\pmb{m}$$ using Alice's public key $$(A, \pmb{b})$$.
In order to perform the encryption, he needs to:

1. Generate his own secret $$\pmb{s}'\in\mathbb{Z}^{1\times n}$$ with entries sampled uniformly from $$[0,q-1]$$.
2. Compute $$\pmb{b}' = \pmb{s}'A + \pmb{e}'$$
3. Compute $$\pmb{v}' = \pmb{s}'\pmb{b}  + \pmb{e}''$$
4. Compute $$\pmb{c} = \pmb{v}' + \left\lfloor \frac{q}{2}\right\rfloor\pmb{m}$$

Bob then sends $$(\pmb{b}', \pmb{c})$$ to Alice.

***

### Decryption

***

Decryption is done by computing a value close to $$\pmb{m}$$ as follows

1. Compute $$\pmb{v} = \pmb{b}'\pmb{s}$$
2. Compute $$\pmb{m}' = \pmb{c} - \pmb{v}\approx \left\lfloor \frac{q}{2}\right\rfloor\pmb{m}$$

$$\pmb{m}$$ and $$\pmb{m}'$$ are not identical but let's examine their difference:

$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{m}' - \pmb{m} &= \pmb{c} - \pmb{v} - (\pmb{c} - \pmb{v}') \\
&= \pmb{c} - \pmb{c} + \pmb{v}' - \pmb{v}\\
&= \pmb{s}'\pmb{b}  + \pmb{e}'' - \pmb{b}'\pmb{s}\\
&= \pmb{s}'(A\pmb{s} + \pmb{e}) + \pmb{e}'' - (\pmb{s}'A + \pmb{e}')\pmb{s}\\
&= \pmb{s}'A\pmb{s} - \pmb{s}'A\pmb{s} + \pmb{s}'\pmb{e} - \pmb{e}'\pmb{s} + \pmb{e}''\\
&= \pmb{s}'\pmb{e} - \pmb{e}'\pmb{s} + \pmb{e}''\\
\implies |\pmb{m}' - \pmb{m} |&\lesssim q/4
\end{align*}
$$

Since the error was taken from a Gaussian distribution, we can say that with high probability
it will be small. This is what justifies the magnitude of the difference being small in the last step
so rounding to the nearest value most likely return the original message

## Conclusion

***

Lattice-based algorithms seem to be leading in popularity for post-quantum encryption so studying them continues to be
important for anyone who uses crytography in their field.

Note that worst-case hardness proofs also requires that the distribution used to
sample the error should have a standard deviation $$\sigma$$ such that
$$\sigma\times q>\sqrt{n}$$.
