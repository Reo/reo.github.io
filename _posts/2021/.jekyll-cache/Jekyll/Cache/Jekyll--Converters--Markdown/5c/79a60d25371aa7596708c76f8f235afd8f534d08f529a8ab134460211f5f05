I"%<p>It has become common to see the disasterous effects of ransomware
making front-page news. Everywhere from
<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7963652/humber-river-hospital-ransomware-attack-toronto/">hospitals</a>
to
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/attack-on-meat-supplier-came-from-revil-ransomwares-most-cut-throat-gang/">meat suppliers</a>,
it seems to paint a tragic picture with little hope.
This is why an article describing
<a href="https://redcanary.com/blog/how-one-hospital-thwarted-a-ryuk-ransomware-outbreak/">how a hospital staved off a Ryuk ransomware outbreak</a>
to be particularly interesting. The article uses the MITRE
attack framework to describe the behaviour of the malware
and points where it may be detected before causing potentially
irrepairable damage.</p>
