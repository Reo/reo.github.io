<p>
  I am a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the department
  of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at the
  University of Toronto Scarborough. I have assisted
  in the instruction of computer science and math
  courses; particularly courses teaching how the
  C programming language behaves under the hood.

  My main focus is on cryptographic protocols which
  help form the foundation for modern communication
  (and more). I find it extremely rewarding to get
  a deeper understanding of technologies new and old
  or learn new skills altogether. In my spare time,
  I play music in an ensemble and love going to concerts.
