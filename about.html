  I have been interested in security for as far back as I remember, as I child I would get into trouble for finding ways
to get inside places shouldn't. Besides security I have also had a fascination with the structure
modern algebra finds in mathematics;
specifically, I want to continue studying algebraic geometry. The intersection of these topics have led me to
find a particular interest in cryptography when it comes to cyber security. In my time at the University of
Toronto I have since done a research project on security protocols and attacks on Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
