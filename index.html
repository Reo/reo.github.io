<p>This serves predominantly as a place to host short articles in the form of blog posts.
  I've learned these help me stay updated and also find gaps in my knowledge.
  Articles currently include cryptography challenges, short overviews of selected exploits,
  and the mathematical background behind them.
  There are also a few bite-sized research projects on topics I find interesting.</p>
